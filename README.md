🏠 Supervised Machine Learning Projects
Description

This repository contains Supervised Machine Learning projects built using Python and scikit-learn. It demonstrates how to solve predictive tasks (regression and classification) using real-world datasets.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature handling, model training with sklearn algorithms, and evaluation using standard metrics. Projects cover numeric, ordinal, and categorical features, including proper handling of missing values and one-hot encoding where necessary.

Key Points

Problem: Automate predictions using historical data.

Data: Real-world datasets with diverse feature types.

Models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and other supervised ML models from scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Standard metrics such as MAE, MSE, R² Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

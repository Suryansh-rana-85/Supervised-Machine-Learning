🏠 House Price Prediction – Supervised Learning
Description

This repository contains a Supervised Machine Learning project to predict house prices using historical residential property data. A Linear Regression model is built to estimate house prices based on features like lot size, building type, condition, construction year, and basement area.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a regression model in Python using pandas and scikit-learn.

Key Points

Problem: Predict SalePrice of houses automatically.

Data: Residential properties with physical, location, and condition features.

Features Handled: Numeric, ordinal, and categorical variables (one-hot encoded).

Model: Linear Regression

Evaluation: MAE, MSE, R² Score

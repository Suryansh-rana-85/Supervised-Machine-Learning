# Supervised Machine Learning

This repository contains Supervised Machine Learning projects. It demonstrates how to solve predictive tasks (regression and classification) using real-world datasets taken from kaggle and other online sources.

The workflow includes data preprocessing -> feature engineering -> model training with sklearn algorithms -> evaluation using standard metrics. 

# Key Points:

Problem: Train the model on learning data and find predictions for testing data.

Data: Real-world datasets with diverse feature types.

Models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and other supervised ML models from scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Standard metrics such as MAE, MSE, R2 Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
